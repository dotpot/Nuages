Nuages is an attempt to create an easy way to expose a - truly - RESTful API using Python and Django.

**Nuages is a work in progress, and not ready for primetime yet.**

-	Experiment with a new design focused on *API nodes* 
-	Self-describing
-	DRY


#Features
-	Design API nodes, not views and controllers
-	Paging, Hyperlinks, web-browsable


#Requirements
